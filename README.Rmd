R package to obtain allometric coefficients of fish from [FishBase](https://www.fishbase.se/), via web scraping.

Developed to facilitate ecological and morphometric analyses of species, especially useful for research in ecology, fish biology and fisheries management.

## Installation

To install directly from GitHub:

```r
# Install the remotes package if you don't have it already
install.packages("remotes")
```

# Install fishmetricR from GitHub
remotes::install_github("jrz-s/fishmetricR")

# Install fishbaseallometricR from GitHub
remotes::install_github("jrz-s/fishmetricR")

# Load package

library(fishmetricR)

# Application example

Example 1: Retrieve coefficients for a single species

get_allometric(genus = "Brycon", species = "orthotaenia")

Example 2: Retrieve coefficients for multiple species

get_fish_allometric(
  genus = c("Clarias", "Piaractus", "Brycon"),
  species = c("gariepinus", "brachypomus", "orthotaenia"))
  
# What it does?  
  
The get_allometric() function performs web scraping of FishBase to collect allometric coefficients.

The data returned includes:

- **a**: slope of the length-weight equation

- **b**: exponent of the length-weight equation

It also includes other relevant information such as minimum and maximum sizes, location, sample size, R², etc.

## Allometric equation

FishBase provides length-weight relationships based on the classical allometric equation:

$$
W = a \cdot L^b
$$

Where:

- \( W \) is the body weight (usually in grams),
- \( L \) is the total, standard, or fork length (usually in centimeters),
- \( a \) is the intercept coefficient (related to body form), and
- \( b \) is the allometric exponent (related to growth pattern).

To estimate these coefficients using linear regression, the equation is log-transformed into its linear form:

$$
\log_{10}(W) = \log_{10}(a) + b \cdot \log_{10}(L)
$$

This transformation allows the estimation of \( \log_{10}(a) \) and \( b \) using ordinary least squares. FishBase provides the values of \( a \) and \( b \) obtained through this procedure. The parameter \( b \) is biologically informative — for example:

- \( b \approx 3 \): isometric growth (body shape remains proportional),
- \( b > 3 \): positive allometric growth (fish become stouter as they grow),
- \( b < 3 \): negative allometric growth (fish become more elongated as they grow).
